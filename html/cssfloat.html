    <h2>The float property</h2>
    <p>The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.</p>
    <h3>Float Right</h3>
    <p><img src="/images/hibiscus.jpeg" alt="hibiscus">Hibiscus[2][3] is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus Ã— rosa-sinensis.[4] A tea made from the flowers of Hibiscus sabdariffa is known by many names around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is known for its red colour, tart flavour, and Vitamin C content.The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, often with a toothed or lobed margin (dentate). The flowers are large and conspicuous.</p>
    <pre style="font-size: large;"><strong>Note:</strong>Likewise, we can put float as left to move the image to left.
Same for none.</pre>

    <h2>Float next to each other</h2>
    <div class="div1">Div 1</div>
    <div class="div2">Div 2</div>
    <div class="div3">Div 3</div><br><br>

    <h2>CSS layout-clear and clearfix</h2>
    <p>When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.</p>
    
    <h2>Without clear</h2>
    <p class="nclr">div1</p>
    <p class="nclr1">div2 - Notice that div2 is after div1 in the HTML code. However, since div1 floats to the left, the text in div2 flows around div1.</div>
    <br><br>

    <br><h2>With clear</h2>
    <p class="clr">div3</p>
    <p class="clr1">div4 - Here, clear: left; moves div4 down below the floating div3. The value "left" clears elements floated to the left. You can also clear "right" and "both".</p>
