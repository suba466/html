    This paragraph
    contains       a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the     browser
    ignores it.
</p>
<p>In the above 2 cases we understood that, The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed. For that we can use horizontal rule(hr), break(br), or we can use pre to print the txt as we typed. which is gn below:</p>
<h5>we use hr</h5>
<h4>This is heading 1</h4>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>

<h4>This is heading 2</h4>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<h4>This is heading 2</h4>
<p>This is some other text.</p>

<h5>we use br</h5>
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

<h5>we use pre</h5>
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
